# What is this?

This is an exercise. \
No AI. \
No copy and paste. \
No shortcuts. \
Just manuals, specifications and documentation. \
This will be a marathon, not a sprint as it will take a considerable amount of time, but that's ok.

# The exercise

The exercise will consist of implementing a simple application to display data/timeseries coming from various sources.
It is not something revolutionary, I won't implement the next Grafana. This is just an exercise to asses my skills, practice what I've studied and take my time to enjoy coding.
I've chose this project so that I could challenge myself to implement **from scratch**:
- An MQTT broker
- A database (yes, it will be very basic)
- A backend with an HTTP api (raw sockets only)


Also, I'm already familiar with all of these concepts, but I've never deep dived into them.

The langueage of choice is Rust. Why? Because I never wrote more than a few lines of code in Rust. Also, I want to understand why a lot of people love it so much.

For the frontend I will use TS + React + some component library (probably [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)), as it is not in the scope of this exercise forcusing on webdev (maybe there will be an exercise #2).

Lastly, this will be a monolith. No microservices madness. 

# The repo

This repo will contain all the code implemented for the exercise and every component will have its subfolder with its README.
Under `journey` I will document the process of designing and developing the system
